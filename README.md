Application under construction...
live: https://rezervo.github.io/Reservo-frontend/

 How it's working?
 
 - The first window is the registration form.  You can register as a customer and as a company.
 - After pressing the "register" button, the validation of the form will be started.
 - a script will be added soon, which will transfer the user to the appropriate panel after the form has been correctly completed, currently, in order to test the application, after clicking the button, you can manually move to the appropriate panel, depending on whether you have registered as a client or as a company.
 - in order to test the application after registering as a company, you can go to the customer panel and select the service (so far there are 3 to choose from), which we chose when registering the company, then after selecting the appropriate city and selecting the option to display the address of the premises, the address of the company should appear  that was entered during registration and the name of the service provider.
